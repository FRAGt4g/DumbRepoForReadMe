# LASA's Complex Number Library
This is a c++ library created by the LASA Adv Computer Science Departement. It allows for the creation and many common math functions for complex numbers such as +,-,/,*,arg,abs,cos,sin,tan,cosh,sinh,tanh... This library builds off of c++'s cmath library but that will be automatically imported. The team behind this library is Miles Fritzmather, Binh Strubhar, Saffron Liu, Yohannes Heinaman, and Sanwi Sirode. This particular README was created by Miles Fritzmather.

# Getting Started
... idk bruh I just made some functions

# Prerequisites
Catch Amalgamated
Cmake
G++

# Running the Tests
There are built in tests for this library that can be run to ensure the functions are all working correctly. In order to run these tests navigate in the shell to the highest folder containing all Complex Library files. then run the command 'make test'. When that finishes compiling, run './main_test.out' to actually run the tests.

# Built with cmath & iosteam imports
